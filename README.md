## IntelliJ Docker Plugin Setup
### Add Docker Integration Plugin to IntelliJ
1. Install Docker Integration Plugin to IntelliJ as explained here https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/docker.html
2. Restart IntelliJ

### Configure the Docker daemon connection settings
1. Go to Settings/Preferences dialog, click Docker under Build, Execution, Deployment.
2. Add a Docker configuration (The Add (+) button) and specify how to connect to the Docker daemon. I was running on Mac, and selected the `Docker for Mac option`
3. I left the Path mappings with default /Users option
4. The connection settings depend on your Docker version and operating system. For more information, check `Enable Docker Support` section here: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/docker.html
5. If it is set correct, you will see a `Connection Successful` message at the bottom of the dialog.

### Check/Test the Docker Tool Window.
1. Go to your project, and open the `Docker Tool Window` from menu `View -> Tool Windows -> Docker`
2. You can see Containers and Images in your local Docker in this tool window. You can also Start/Stop Docker Plugin from this tool window. https://screencast.com/t/jgi8SreiA
